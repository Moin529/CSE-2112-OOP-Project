# CSE-2112-OOP-Project
Travel and Tourism Management. A project where you can learn about various principles and designs of object oriented programming. Project is coded in Java language. Some other useful tools were: 
1. Programming Language: Java
2. GUI Design: Java Swing
3. JDBC: MySQL
4. IDE: Netbeans

Four main principles of Object Oriented Programming are present in this project:
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

Some other principles of OOP featured in this project are:
1. Thread
2. Exception Handling

Some data structure principles are also introduced such as:
1. String
2. Array
3. Loops
4. Construct

Overall this project is a result of all the learning outcomes of OOP principles and basic data structures where we implement these to make an application based on real life problems.

1. OS: Windows 10/11
2. JRE: jdk-12 or above
3. IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans recommended. (Project has been built in NetBeans)
